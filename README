A Python3 implementation of various trading strategies for bitcoin on coinbase

1. Set API_KEY and API_SECRET as environment variables, for instance in ~/.zshenv if you use zsh or in 
~/.bashrc if you use bash.

2. The file trade.py defines all the functions necessary for executing trades on coinbase

3. For safety reasons the program asks you in the beginning whether you want to execute real trades or
if you just want to carry out simulations. If you want it to execute real trades enter 'y'. Be warned 
that the author is not responsible for any financial losses incurred as a consequence.

4. Strategies are supposed to go into strategies.py

5. So far the only strategy implemented is the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI)

The author wishes to thank Sebastian Pokutta for the idea.
