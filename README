A Python3 implementation of various trading strategies for bitcoin on coinbase

1. Set API_KEY and API_SECRET as environment variables, for instance in ~/.zshenv

2. The file trade.py defines all the functions necessary for executing trades on coinbase

3. For testing purposes, in buy and sell requests the variable commit is set to false. 
To execute real trades, set them to true inside the definitions of buy and sell functions 
in trade.py.

4. Strategies are supposed to go into strategies.py

5. So far the only strategy implemented is the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI)
